# 🎓 FaceX – Face Recognition Based Attendance System

**FaceX** is a full-stack facial recognition-based attendance tracker tailored for university environments. It automates attendance using facial recognition and provides manual admin-level controls for viewing and editing student records.

This project integrates a Flutter Web Admin Panel, Node.js + MongoDB Backend, and a Python Face Scanner using FaceNet.

---

## 🚀 Features

### 👨‍💼 Admin Panel (Flutter Web)
- Add new students with name, reg_no, email, password, and face image.
- Automatically renames face image to registration number.
- Dynamically view all added students in a sidebar list.
- Remove students with confirmation dialog.
- View subject-wise attendance for any student.
- Navigate to attendance manager for manual edits.

### 🤖 Face Scanner (Python + FaceNet)
- Captures face via webcam or uploads image.
- Generates face embeddings using FaceNet.
- Compares with stored embeddings using cosine similarity.
- Sends attendance record to backend using `/attendance/mark`.

### 🛠 Backend (Node.js + MongoDB)
- REST APIs for student and admin login, attendance management.
- Auto-marks students as **Absent** if not present during the scheduled slot.
- CRON-based absentee scheduler that runs as per time table.
- Image uploads are stored at a fixed path and cleaned on student deletion.

## ⚙️ Setup Guide

### 🔧 Backend Setup

```bash
cd backend
npm install
```

Create a `.env` file:

```
MONGO_URI=mongodb+srv://<your_uri>
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
```

Start the server:

```bash
node server.js
```

> 📌 Ensure your upload path is correctly defined in `multer.diskStorage`:
```js
const dir = 'D:/Downloads/My Apps(Built Ones)/FaceX/FaceXScanner/uploads';
```

---

### 🌐 Flutter Web Frontend

```bash
cd frontend
flutter pub get
flutter run -d chrome
```

> Requires Flutter SDK and Chrome browser installed.

---

### 🧠 Face Scanner (Python)

```bash
cd FaceXScanner
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py
```

Make sure you update paths inside `app.py`:
```python
MODEL_DIR = "D:/FaceX/facenet_model"
UPLOAD_DIR = "D:/Downloads/My Apps(Built Ones)/FaceX/FaceXScanner/uploads"
ATTENDANCE_API = "http://localhost:5000/attendance/mark"
SIMILARITY_THRESHOLD = 0.7
```

## 📊 Attendance Flow

1. Admin adds students from Flutter UI with face image.
2. Image gets renamed to registration number and saved to `uploads/`.
3. Scanner captures live face, encodes embedding via FaceNet.
4. Backend compares and marks **Present** if match found.
5. At each subject end time, CRON checks for unmarked students and adds **Absent** records.
